[Sentiment analysis in Turkish: Supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised techniques](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/natural-language-engineering/article/abs/sentiment-analysis-in-turkish-supervised-semisupervised-and-unsupervised-techniques/3E5CAB8E6A2B8877135F63485536C8F9).

In this study, sentiment analysis is performed in Turkish and English. To achieve this, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised approaches have been developed and applied. The supervised methods include LSTM, CNN, and delta-IDF techniques. For Turkish, a morphological analysis is also incorporated, further improving performance. The methods are evaluated on datasets from various genres, making the approach cross-domain and easily adaptable to other languages.

## Requirements

- numpy
- tensorflow
- tqdm
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- pandas
- nltk
- jpype1

In addition to Python packages, the Zemberek tool, originally written in Java, was also used for high-quality morphological analysis of Turkish texts. To enable this, the jpype1 library was utilized.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create Python virtual environment (e.g., `python -m venv my_venv`).
3. Activate it: `source my_venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

I leveraged `Python 3.9` when running the code.

```

## Usage

Run the below exemplary command to run the CNN method for English.

```bash
python main.py supervised --method cnn --lang english --dataset datasets/english/english_sentiment_data.csv 
```

If you only want to run the LSTM approach for Turkish, you can utilize the below exemplary command:

```bash
python main.py supervised --method lstm --lang turkish --dataset datasets/turkish/turkish_sentiment_data.csv --epochs 5 --batch_size 32

```
